# üìÑ DocStream  

**DocStream** is a distributed document platform that processes and analyzes documents in order to extract standardized and structured insights.  
It leverages a microservices architecture, asynchronous messaging, and modern DevOps practices to deliver fast, reliable, and maintainable insights from complex files.  

---

**Note**: DocStream is currently under active development and is not yet fully functional.
Some services, configurations, and integrations are still being implemented.
A complete, runnable version (including working Docker Compose setup) will be released soon.
In the meantime, you can explore the architecture and source code.

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **Multi-format support**: PDF, DOCX, TXT (future support for scanned images/OCR).  
- **Microservices-based design**: Each service encapsulates a single responsibility for scalability and maintainability.  
- **Asynchronous messaging**: Built on **RabbitMQ**, enabling decoupled communication and retry/DLQ strategies.  
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automated testing, build, and deployment using **GitHub Actions**.  
- **Observability**: Integrated **OpenTelemetry** for metrics, logs, and traces across services.  
- **Resilience**: Implements retry logic, error handling, and resource monitoring.  
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new processing modules without impacting the core system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

**Programming & Frameworks**  
- Python 3.11+  
- FastAPI (for REST/gRPC service interfaces)  
- gRPC (service-to-service communication)  

**Infrastructure & Messaging**  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- RabbitMQ (asynchronous messaging, fanout and direct exchanges)  
- MinIO (object storage for uploaded and processed files)  

**DevOps & Quality**  
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)  
- pytest (unit & integration tests)  
- OpenTelemetry (distributed tracing & metrics collection)  
- SonarQube (static code analysis, code quality gates)

## üìà Impact  
- Reduced the time needed to extract structured insights from complex documents by automating parsing and analysis.  
- Provided a **robust and scalable** architecture aligned with **12-Factor App** methodology and **SOLID principles**.  
- Demonstrated real-world application of **cloud-native patterns** (microservices, observability, CI/CD, containerization).
